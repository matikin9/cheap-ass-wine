# Seaglass

California pinot noir - bought at Whole Foods for $9.99.

"Santa Barbara County's coastal mountains possess an east-west orientation that allows for the flow of ocean breezes and fog, producing ideal growing conditions for Pinot Noir.

Delicate aromas of ripe cherry and cranberry with notes of dried spring flowers, cola and clove seamlessly blend together.  Medium-bodied and beautifully balanced with a soft lingering finish."
