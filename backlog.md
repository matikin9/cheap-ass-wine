Red blend from South Eastern Australia

"Rise up against ordinary flavors and timid wins.  Break free with a defiantly bold, intense blend.  Nativ Australian winemaker, Steve Roden, delivers just that.  Made with grapes from acclaimed cool climate vineyards in South Eastern Australia, Insurrection wine provides rich, concentrated layers of ripe fruit adn spice that are tamed only by a long, smooth finish."

# Montes

$7.99 from Costco

Cabernet Sauvignon from Colchagua Valley in Chile

"Our estates, located in the heart of the Colchagua Valley, are some of the best winemaking areas in Chile.  We aim to produce the highest quality wines which subtly marry rich fruit flavours with French oak, aged for six months.  This wine has intense ruby-red colour and the nose is packed with layers of caramel, cinnamon, candy and hints of mint, with a prevalence of fruit over the French oak.  This spicy, full flavoured wine, with good body, fruit adn firm tannins has an engaging and long finish.  Also recommended for mid term cellaring.
