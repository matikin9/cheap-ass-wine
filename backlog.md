Cabernet Sauvignon from Colchagua Valley in Chile

"Our estates, located in the heart of the Colchagua Valley, are some of the best winemaking areas in Chile.  We aim to produce the highest quality wines which subtly marry rich fruit flavours with French oak, aged for six months.  This wine has intense ruby-red colour and the nose is packed with layers of caramel, cinnamon, candy and hints of mint, with a prevalence of fruit over the French oak.  This spicy, full flavoured wine, with good body, fruit adn firm tannins has an engaging and long finish.  Also recommended for mid term cellaring.

# The Buccaneer

California Sauvignon

"Our winemakers, modern-day Buccaneers explore the vineyardas from ridge-top to valley floor in search of the ripest blocks to bring to the winery.  After harvest they plunder the cellar to find the best of the lots to craft this dark, stormy, and mysterious wine.  The Buccaneer is a rich, lusty wine that drinks well with hearty dishes and satisfies the thirst for adventure and exploration.  Be the Buccaneer!"
